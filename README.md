IS 2- PROJECT(VOICE-BASED DISEASE DIAGNOSING SYSTEM BASED ON THE SYMPTOMS USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING)
This paper presents a Voice-Based Disease Diagnosing System, a novel approach aimed at assisting individuals in diagnosing diseases based on their reported symptoms. The system leverages voice recognition technology and natural language processing techniques to enable users, including visually impaired individuals, to interact with the system using voice commands or natural language input. The proposed system addresses the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods by providing a convenient and accessible platform for preliminary symptom-based assessments. Users can verbally describe their symptoms, and the system analyses and processes the input to identify potential diseases based on a comprehensive medical knowledge base. The system incorporates advanced algorithms to perform symptom analysis, disease assessment, and information presentation. It generates accurate and context-aware disease diagnoses, providing users with information about the suggested conditions, possible causes, risk factors, and general management options. Additionally, the system facilitates secure collaboration between users and healthcare professionals. Users can securely share the generated diagnoses with healthcare professionals for further evaluation, discussion, and treatment decisions. The Voice-Based Disease Diagnosing System offers benefits such as improved healthcare accessibility, time efficiency, and user convenience. It empowers individuals by providing an inclusive and accessible platform for disease diagnosis. The system has the potential to complement the expertise of healthcare professionals, enhance healthcare access, and promote early detection of diseases.
